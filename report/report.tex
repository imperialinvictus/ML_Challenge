\section{Prediction}
% How well would you expect your model to perform on the test set? We are looking for:
% – A point estimate for your performance, not a range.
% – A reasoned explanation of your expected model performance, with empirical evidence supporting your explanation. You are not graded on the closeness of your estimate to the final test accuracy, but you are graded on your reasoning.

\section{Workload Distribution}
% A description of what each person in the group contributed to the project. A 1-2 sentence description of each person’s role is sufficient. Each student’s description must be written by that
% student in order for them to receive credit for the project.
