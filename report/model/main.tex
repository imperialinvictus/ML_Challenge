\section{Model}
A description of the model(s) that you are evaluating/exploring. We are expecting a thorough
exploration of at least 3+ family of models1, even if you don’t ultimately use those models. We are looking for:
– How you are applying these models. You don’t need to reiterate what the models are and how they work. Instead, we’re looking for a description of the choices you are making to apply the model to this task: e.g., what features from the “Data” section are you using for each model? What adjustments (if any) did you need to make?
